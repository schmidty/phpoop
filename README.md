## PHP OOP Abstract, Interface Examples

* To run this:  php -S localhost:8000
* In browser go to url:  http://localhost:8000

#### Goals:
* I wanted to show a quick little simple example of using an PHP abstract and interface together in an object oriented fashion.
* Implement design pattern using simple dependency injection.
* Using constants from a class
