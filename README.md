## PHP OOP Abstract, Interface Examples

* To run this:  php -S localhost:8000
* In browser go to url:  http://localhost:8000

#### Goals:
* Wrote my own quick little autoloader based on reading the http://php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php 
	* I included a quick check script should a question of whether the classes were loaded or not?
    * To use this in browser go to url:  http://localhost:8000/autoload.test.php
* I wanted to show a quick little simple example of using an PHP abstract and interface together in an object oriented fashion.
* Implement design pattern using simple dependency injection.
* Using constants from a class after reviewing http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.php
